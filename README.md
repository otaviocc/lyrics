Never search for lyrics again. Point `lyrics` at your music library and it drops a `.lrc` or
`.txt` file next to every track, pulled from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) or
[lrcmux](https://lrcmux.dev), free and key-less lyrics providers. Synced, timestamped lyrics
whenever they exist; plain text otherwise.

**Your audio files are never touched.** `lyrics` only reads tags and writes sidecar files next
to them.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install otaviocc/apps/lyrics
```

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install lyrics-sidecar
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/otaviocc/lyrics.git
cd Lyrics
make install
```

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) to build. `make uninstall` removes it.

## Quick start

```sh
lyrics scan ~/Music                                                    # your whole library
lyrics scan "~/Music/Metallica"                                        # just one artist or album
lyrics track "~/Music/Metallica/...And Justice for All/04 One.flac"    # a single file
lyrics show "One" --artist "Metallica"                                 # no audio file needed
lyrics tui "One" --artist "Metallica" --counter                        # follow along, teleprompter-style
lyrics stats ~/Music                                                   # coverage census, read-only
lyrics lint "~/Music/Metallica/...And Justice for All/04 One.lrc"      # check a sidecar's sync format
lyrics ebook ~/Music -o Lyrics.epub                                    # bind your lyrics into a book
```

`show` looks up lyrics by artist and track name (no audio file required) and displays them in a
pager. Timestamps are dimmed by default; pass `--no-color` to disable that.

Run it again whenever you like: already-synced tracks are skipped, and anything still missing
gets tried again in case it's shown up since.

Want to see what would happen first?

```sh
lyrics scan ~/Music --dry-run -v
```

## How it works

Title, artist, album, and duration come straight from your files' embedded tags, so there's no
required folder structure. If some of your files are missing tags, add `--path-fallback` to
fill the gaps in from `Artist/Album/NN Title.ext`-style paths instead of skipping them.

Titles with a version marker, like `Machine Gun Man (Acoustic) [Bonus Track]` or
`The Wizard [Live]`, are handled automatically: if the exact title comes up empty, `lyrics`
retries with the marker stripped.

## Following along

**`lyrics tui`** is a full-screen teleprompter: the current lyric line stays centered on
screen, earlier lines scroll up above it, and later lines wait below.

```sh
lyrics tui "One" --artist "Metallica" --counter   # fetch, then 3, 2, 1, PLAY
lyrics tui --file "~/Music/Metallica/...And Justice for All/04 One.lrc"
```

Without `--file`, `tui` looks the track up the same way `show` does (`--artist` is required,
`--album` optionally narrows the match) and needs synced lyrics — a plain-only or instrumental
result is an error. With `--file`, it reads that `.lrc` straight from disk and never makes a
network request.

The clock is yours to drive, not tied to anything external: it starts paused at `00:00`, and
you press Space at the same moment you hit play in your music player. `--counter` shows a
`3, 2, 1, PLAY` countdown first, so you can time that press exactly, and starts the clock the
instant `PLAY` appears.

During an intro or an instrumental break of 5s or more, the `♪` counts down to the next line
(`♪ 0:12`), so you can tell at a glance whether the clock is still in sync with the record.

To cue a line by hand, pause, move to it with `↑`/`↓`, and press `Enter` the moment the singer
starts it: playback resumes from the start of that line.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | play / pause |
| `←`/`h`, `→`/`l` | seek 5s back / forward |
| `Shift-←`/`H`, `Shift-→`/`L` | seek 10s back / forward |
| `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j` | jump to the previous / next line |
| `,` / `.` | nudge the clock ∓0.1s, for fine sync |
| `<` / `>` | nudge the clock ∓0.5s |
| `Enter` | paused: start the current line now; playing: snap to the nearest line |
| `0` / `r` | restart at `00:00`, paused |
| `c` | replay the countdown |
| `?` | show every key |
| `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-c` | quit |

`tui` draws lyrics on the alternate screen for you to follow along with — its whole job is to
display them, unlike every other command, which never prints lyric bodies to stdout/stderr.

### Themes

`tui` ships the same bundled TOML themes as [rewind](https://github.com/otaviocc/rewind) and
[vademecum](https://github.com/otaviocc/vademecum): `stage` (the default), `ansi`,
`catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `default-plus`, `gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light`,
`kanagawa-dragon`, `nord`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `tokyo-night`,
`tokyo-night-day`, and `vesper`.

```sh
lyrics tui --list-themes            # every built-in, plus any of your own
lyrics tui "One" --artist "Metallica" --theme nord
```

Pick a default in `config.toml` (see [Configuration](#configuration)), or write your own at
`~/.config/lyrics/theme.toml` — or under a name, at
`~/.config/lyrics/themes/<name>.toml`, to select with `--theme <name>`. A theme file only needs
to state what it wants to change; anything left unset falls through to the built-in default.
See any bundled theme in [`themes/`](themes/) for the full format.

## Reading your library

**`lyrics ebook <dir>`** builds an EPUB out of the lyrics already sitting beside your music.
It makes no network requests: it reads tags and existing sidecars, and nothing else. Fetch
first with `scan`, then bind the result into a book.

The book is organized the way a shelf is. Each artist is a chapter, grouped by the album-artist
tag so compilations stay together; each album is a subchapter opening with its `folder.jpg` and
its full tracklist, split into `CD 1` / `CD 2` sections for multi-disc releases. Every track on
an album is listed, whether or not it has lyrics — the ones that do are links to their page. The
cover is a collage of art from across your library. Each song's lyrics get a page of their own,
with the timestamps stripped out.

```sh
lyrics ebook ~/Music -o Lyrics.epub
lyrics ebook ~/Music --title "My Collection" --author "Me" -v
```

Tracks with no sidecar are still listed on their album, but get no page. An album no track of
which has lyrics is left out entirely, as is an artist left with nothing.

The output is a standard EPUB 3, validated against the spec with
[epubcheck](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/), and it opens in Apple Books, Kobo,
Calibre, and anything else that reads EPUB. The cover's title is drawn into the image itself, so
it survives a reader's night mode instead of being restyled out of legibility.

## Checking your library

Two read-only commands make no network requests and never write anything:

- **`lyrics stats <dir>`** surveys a directory tree's coverage — how many tracks are synced,
  plain, or missing, broken down by format, plus a count of orphaned sidecars (a `.lrc`/`.txt`
  left behind after its audio file was renamed or deleted). Pass `-v` to list the orphan
  paths. A fast way to check whether a `scan` is even worth running.
- **`lyrics lint <path>...`** checks one or more `.lrc` files (or directories, searched
  recursively) for format and sync problems: malformed timestamps, out-of-order or duplicate
  timestamps, non-canonical `[MM:SS.xx]` formatting, and unknown metadata tags. Useful after
  hand-editing a sidecar to fix a typo. Exits non-zero on any error, or on any warning under
  `--strict`.

## Options

```text
Selection
  --force                   Re-fetch even tracks that already have a synced .lrc
  --path-fallback           Fill in missing tags from the file path
  --no-search-fallback      Don't fall back to a fuzzy search when the exact lookup misses
  --no-marker-fallback      Don't retry with title markers like (Acoustic)/[Live] stripped
  --duration-tolerance <S>  Max duration mismatch to still accept a match  [default: 2]

Output
  --dry-run                 Show what would happen; write nothing
  --keep-plain              Keep the old .txt around after upgrading to synced
  -v, --verbose             Show per-track detail  (-vv adds request timing)
  -q, --quiet               Only print the final summary
  --no-color                Disable colored output in `show`

Network
  --provider <NAME>         lrclib or lrcmux  [default: lrclib]
  --delay-ms <MS>           Delay between requests  [default: 300]
  --max-retries <N>         Retries for 429/5xx responses before giving up  [default: 3]
  --user-agent <STR>        Override the identifying User-Agent

Config file
  --config <PATH>           Load config from this path instead of the default location
  --no-config               Ignore the config file; use only built-in defaults and CLI flags

Ebook (`lyrics ebook` only)
  -o, --output <PATH>       Where to write the book  [default: ./Lyrics.epub]
  --title <STR>             Book title, shown on the cover  [default: Lyrics]
  --author <STR>            Book author, written to the EPUB metadata
  -v, --verbose             Log each album as it is added
  -q, --quiet               Only print the final summary
```

Run `lyrics scan --help` or `lyrics track --help` for the full, always up-to-date list. The
first four groups apply to `scan`, `track`, `show`, and `tui` (when it's fetching); `stats`,
`lint`, and `ebook` are read-only and take no network or selection options, and neither does
`tui --file`. `tui` additionally takes `--file`, `--counter`, `--theme`, and `--list-themes`;
see [Following along](#following-along).

## Configuration

Persistent defaults live at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lyrics/config.toml`, or
`~/.config/lyrics/config.toml` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isn't set — the same path on every
platform, including macOS. Precedence is: **built-in default → config file → CLI flag**, so a
flag on the command line always wins.

```toml
[options]
provider = "lrclib"
delay_ms = 500
path_fallback = true
keep_plain = true

[lrclib]
user_agent = "MyPrivateLyricsBot/1.0"

[tui]
theme = "nord"
```

Every value option (`provider`, `delay_ms`, `max_retries`, `duration_tolerance`,
`user_agent`) and boolean flag (`path_fallback`, `keep_plain`, `no_search_fallback`,
`no_marker_fallback`, `no_color`) under `[options]` is supported. `[lrclib]`/`[lrcmux]` accept
a provider-specific `user_agent` that overrides `[options].user_agent` when that provider is
selected. `[tui].theme` sets `tui`'s default theme; `--theme` on the command line overrides it
for that run.

`force`, `dry_run`, `verbose`, and `quiet` are **not** configurable — a config that silently
forces every run to re-fetch, silently makes every run a no-op, or fights with itself over
verbosity is a footgun, not a convenience; those stay CLI-only.

Because a plain CLI flag can't distinguish "not passed" from "explicitly false", a boolean
enabled in the config **can't be turned back off from the CLI** — edit the config instead.
Use `--config <path>` to load from somewhere else, or `--no-config` to ignore the file
entirely for one run.

## Providers

- **`lrclib`** (default): [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net), a community-sourced lyrics database.
- **`lrcmux`**: [lrcmux](https://lrcmux.dev), which aggregates several sources (Genius, KuGou,
  LRCLIB, Musixmatch, YouTube Music) and can turn up lyrics LRCLIB alone doesn't have.

Got `missing` for a track? Try the other provider:

```sh
lyrics track "~/Music/Artist/Album/01 Track.flac" --provider lrcmux
```

## A good citizen

Both providers are free services run by volunteers. `lyrics` identifies itself, keeps requests
sequential with a short delay between them, and backs off properly if it's ever rate-limited. If
this tool saves you time, consider supporting [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) or
[lrcmux](https://lrcmux.dev).

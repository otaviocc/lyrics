# Agent instructions

Instructions for any coding agent working in this repository.

## Invariants: do not break these

1. **Never write to audio files.** The only `lofty` API this codebase may call is
   `lofty::read_from_path` (see `src/meta.rs`). Do not add a call to `save_to`,
   `insert_tag`, or any other tag-mutation API, anywhere, under any flag. Every
   filesystem write must go through `sidecar_path()` in `src/sidecar.rs`, which
   structurally cannot return the input audio path. Before finishing a change that
   touches `src/`, run:

   ```sh
   grep -rn "save_to\|insert_tag\|write_to\b" src/
   ```

   It must return nothing.

2. **Never violate a provider's request contract.** Requests to any provider
   (`lrclib.net`, `api.lrcmux.dev`, or a future one) must stay sequential (never
   concurrent) and throttled (`http::Client`'s `throttle()`); a `429` response's
   `Retry-After` header must be honored, not approximated; every request must carry
   an identifying `User-Agent`. Do not add a `--jobs`/concurrency option, and do
   not add a fallback chain across providers within a run.

3. **Never print lyrics content to stdout/stderr as log output.** Log outcomes and paths
   (`fetched <path>`), not lyric bodies. `tui` is the one command whose entire job is to
   display lyrics: it draws them on the alternate screen (see `ratatui::try_init`/`restore` in
   `src/tui/mod.rs`), leaves nothing in scrollback, and its own errors and notices never quote
   lyric text.

## Module map

```text
src/
  lib.rs      : module declarations; the library crate integration tests link against
  main.rs     : thin binary: parses CLI, wires it to runner, sets the process exit code
  cli.rs      : clap derive definitions (Cli, Command, SharedOptions); SharedOptions::resolve
                is the one place default -> config file -> CLI precedence is defined,
                producing the concrete Options that runner/http actually consume
  config.rs   : ~/.config/lyrics/config.toml loading/parsing; no opinion on precedence
  meta.rs     : TrackMeta resolution: tag reading (lofty) + optional --path-fallback
  provider.rs : ProviderKind enum + ProviderSpec (base URLs, display name) per provider
  http.rs     : HTTP client: throttling, retry/Retry-After handling, /api/get, /api/search,
                candidate scoring; shared across every provider, parameterized by ProviderSpec
  sidecar.rs  : sidecar path derivation, on-disk state detection, atomic writes.
                sidecar_state (Synced/Plain/None, used by scan) is a lossy view over the
                finer-grained sidecar_detail (splits out the instrumental marker, used by
                stats) - widening SidecarState itself would change scan/--force semantics
  runner.rs   : per-track decision logic (process_track), the scan walk, and
                walk_audio_files (shared by scan and stats)
  stats.rs    : read-only coverage census (`lyrics stats`); never constructs an http::Client
  lrc.rs      : LRC parsing: lint checks (`lyrics lint`) and parse_synced, the timeline
                `lyrics tui` plays; also the directory -> .lrc discovery both `lint`
                (resolve_lrc_paths, recursive) and `tui --folder` (synced_files, top
                level only) walk with; never constructs an http::Client
  ebook/      : EPUB generation (`lyrics ebook`); never constructs an http::Client
    mod.rs      : orchestration (collect -> render -> write) and the run Summary
    library.rs  : directory tree -> book model (artists > albums > discs > tracks), reusing
                  runner::walk_audio_files and meta::resolve so it agrees with scan
    lyrics.rs   : sidecar contents -> display stanzas, folding over lrc::parse_line to strip
                  timestamps and metadata tags rather than parsing LRC a second time
    cover.rs    : album-art thumbnails, the cover collage, and the title plate rasterized
                  into it (the `image` and `ab_glyph` crates)
    render.rs   : book model -> XHTML/CSS/OPF/nav; one document per song, which is what
                  guarantees a lyric never shares a page with the previous one
    epub.rs     : the ZIP container (the `zip` crate); mimetype first and stored, per spec
  theme/      : the TOML theme system `tui` draws with, adapted from the sibling `rewind`/
                `vademecum` TUIs' theme module (same file format, palette slots, base
                inheritance); never constructs an http::Client
    mod.rs      : Theme (palette + per-Element styles)
    palette.rs  : the 15 semantic color slots and their TOML shape (PaletteFile)
    color.rs    : ColorSpec parsing (#rrggbb, ANSI names, palette-slot references)
    elements.rs : the Element enum this app actually draws (CurrentLine, HeaderTitle, ...)
                  and their default styles, derived from the palette
    loader.rs   : bundled themes (include_str!), base-chain resolution, --list-themes
  tui/        : `lyrics tui`, the synced-lyrics teleprompter; never constructs an
                http::Client except through the same runner::lookup_lyrics path `show` uses
    mod.rs      : terminal init/restore (ratatui::try_init/restore) and the event loop
    clock.rs    : the listener-controlled playback clock (Space, seek keys); takes an
                  explicit Instant everywhere so it's deterministic under test
    app.rs      : App/Mode state and the Action -> state transitions
    input.rs    : KeyEvent -> Action
    picker.rs   : `--folder`'s song list: the cursor over it and the overlay's geometry.
                  Holds no I/O - lrc::synced_files finds the files, tui::songs_from_dir
                  adapts them to Song
    view.rs     : the frame: header/rules/status chrome plus the centered lyric content
    bigtext.rs  : the --counter countdown's block-glyph digits
    help.rs     : the `?` key table overlay
tests/
  read_only_guarantee.rs  : integration test asserting audio files are unchanged after a run
  no_write_commands.rs    : integration test asserting stats/lint/ebook never write or delete
  epub_validity.rs        : integration test running epubcheck over a generated book; skips
                            (and passes) when epubcheck is not installed
  fixtures/sample.flac    : small tagged fixture (regenerate with the ffmpeg command below)
assets/
  Lora-Regular.ttf        : the cover title's typeface, embedded via include_bytes! in
                            ebook/cover.rs; SIL Open Font License 1.1
  Lora-OFL.txt            : that font's license, which must ship alongside it
```

The cover title is drawn into the cover JPEG rather than written as HTML over it. This is not a
style preference: reading systems re-theme CSS, and Apple Books in night mode discards a
`background-color` outright and substitutes its own text color, which left the title unreadable
on the artwork. No reader re-themes an image. Do not "simplify" this back to a CSS overlay.

Where a change belongs: CLI surface goes in `cli.rs`. Persistent config loading goes in
`config.rs`; how it's merged with CLI flags goes in `cli.rs`'s `SharedOptions::resolve`, not
in `config.rs`. Metadata resolution goes in `meta.rs`. Adding a new LRCLIB-API-compatible
provider is one match arm in `ProviderKind::spec()` in `provider.rs`. Talking to a provider
(throttling, retries, request shape) goes in `http.rs`. What file gets written where, or what
state a sidecar is already in, goes in `sidecar.rs`. The decision of what to do with a track
goes in `runner.rs`. Building the book goes in `ebook/`. `stats`, `lint`, and `ebook` are
read-only, offline commands: none of them should ever construct an `http::Client` or call a
`sidecar::write_*` function; `tui --file` and `tui --folder` follow the same rule (they read
`.lrc` files directly).
`ebook` writes exactly one file, the book, at the path the user named — putting lyrics *in that
file* is not a breach of invariant 3, which is about the standard streams; `tui` drawing lyrics
on the alternate screen is the other named exception to that same invariant. A provider whose
response shape isn't LRCLIB-compatible doesn't fit this seam. Theme parsing and the palette
goes in `theme/`; the teleprompter's own state, input handling, and rendering goes in `tui/`.

## Commands

The `Makefile` is the source of truth for build/test/install commands. Use it rather
than calling `cargo` directly. `make help` lists every target.

```sh
make build        # cargo build
make release       # cargo build --release
make run ARGS="scan ~/Music -v"
make test          # cargo test
make lint          # cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make lint-md       # markdownlint-cli2 (via npx) on every *.md file
make fmt           # cargo fmt, applies changes
make fmt-check     # cargo fmt --check, verifies only
make check         # fmt-check + lint + lint-md + test, the pre-commit gate
make audit         # cargo audit, dependency security advisories
make install       # cargo install --path . --force
make uninstall     # cargo uninstall lyrics-sidecar
make clean         # cargo clean
```

`make check` must pass before considering a change done.

## Testing conventions

- Unit tests (in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of each module) run offline,
  against fixtures. No network calls in `cargo test`, ever.
- `tests/read_only_guarantee.rs` and `tests/no_write_commands.rs` are the integration tests;
  they depend on the crate
  as a library (`src/lib.rs`), not on `#[path]` includes. Keep new integration tests
  the same way.
- Regenerate the fixture, if needed, with:

  ```sh
  ffmpeg -y -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=2" \
    -metadata title="Test Track" -metadata artist="Test Artist" -metadata album="Test Album" \
    tests/fixtures/sample.flac
  ```

- Live calls against a real provider API are for manual verification only. Never wire
  a live network call into `cargo test`.
- `tests/epub_validity.rs` shells out to `epubcheck` to validate a generated book against the
  EPUB 3 spec. It is optional by design: not every machine or CI runner has a JVM, so the test
  reports a skip and passes when `epubcheck` isn't on `PATH`. Install it with
  `brew install epubcheck` to have it actually run. This is not a network call — `epubcheck`
  works offline against a local file.

## Style

- `anyhow::Result` at fallible boundaries (`Client`, `process_track`, `main`, `tui::run`); no
  `unwrap()` outside tests. `theme::loader::ThemeError` is `thiserror`-derived rather than
  `anyhow`, since callers (a future `--list-themes`-style consumer, or a test) may want to
  match on which problem it was; it converts into `anyhow::Error` at the `main.rs` boundary via
  `?` like any other `std::error::Error`.
- **No comments in Rust.** A file carries the two-line copyright/SPDX header and may carry a
  single `//!` line saying what it is, for navigation. Nothing else: no `///`, no `//`. A
  comment is a claim nobody checks, and it lends authority to whatever it sits above. Put the
  explanation in the commit message, which is dated and tied to a diff. If code needs a
  paragraph to be understood, prefer a name, a smaller function, or a test. The invariants
  above are documented here, not in the code. TOML and Markdown *are* commented; the rule is
  about code.
- clap help text is written as `help = "..."` / `about = "..."` / `#[value(help = "...")]`
  attributes, never as doc comments. `make run ARGS="<cmd> --help"` is the check.
- Markdown line-length limit is 100 (see `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`).
- Rust edition 2024, MSRV 1.89 (`Cargo.toml`).
- The HTTP client is blocking (`ureq`), not async. Sequential requests are a design
  choice, not a limitation.
